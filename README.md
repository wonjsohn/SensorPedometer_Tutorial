# SensorPedometer-AndroidStudio

Using Android devices as a sensor to collect Kinematics data. 
Uses Wifi (or Bluetooth) to stream kinematics variables such as Accelerelation, gyro data. 

Major Enhacements:  
-<b>Dynamic visualizatoin of kinematics data </b><br> 
-<b>Filtered sensor data to improve gate event detection.  </b><br> 
-<b>Wifi connectivity to stream data.  </b><br> 
-<b>Write to file.  </b><br>
